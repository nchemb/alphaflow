          <p>
            We‚Äôre <span className="font-medium text-white">Neeraj</span> and <span className="font-medium text-white">Abhi</span>, the founders of AlphaFlow. We have called Chicago home for the past decade, and during that time we have built our careers as technology leaders helping some of the biggest companies in the world design products, improve systems, and implement automation at scale. Our journey through the corporate world taught us not just how to build solutions, but how to build them with efficiency, precision, and lasting business impact.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the past few years, we have worked deeply in artificial intelligence, using AI to automate complex workflows, drive smarter decision making, and deliver measurable results for global organizations. Through that experience, one thing became clear to us: AI should not be limited to large corporations.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-semibold text-center mb-8 gradient-text">Why We Started AlphaFlow</h3>

          <p>
            We created AlphaFlow because we saw a growing challenge that small and medium sized businesses face in today‚Äôs economy. Prices keep rising, margins keep shrinking, and operational inefficiencies are silently draining profits. Data shows that nearly 1 in 5 U.S. businesses shut down within their first year, and almost half do not make it past year five. By the ten year mark, close to two thirds of them have closed their doors.
          </p>

          <p>
            These aren‚Äôt failures of ambition or effort. They are often the result of inefficiencies, outdated systems, and limited resources that make it nearly impossible for business owners to keep up. Studies estimate that inefficiencies can cost companies between twenty to thirty percent of their total revenue every year. That loss can be the difference between survival and closure.
          </p>

          <p>
            At AlphaFlow, we believe AI can change that. The same technologies we have used in large corporations to automate workflows, optimize processes, and enhance decision making can now be applied to small and medium businesses. By introducing AI into everyday operations, we help business owners cut waste, improve productivity, and reclaim the time and profit they deserve.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our mission is to ensure that small businesses, the backbone of every community, not only survive but thrive. With intelligent automation handling the routine, owners can focus on growth, creativity, and building lasting value for their customers.
